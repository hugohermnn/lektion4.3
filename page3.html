     <p style="color: black;">After thirty years of service and an impressive collection of military awards and
        decorations for extraordinary heroism in combat, distinguished US Navy Captain Pete Mitchell,
        call sign Maverick, finds himself exactly where he belongs: pushing the limits as a top test
        pilot. Despite avoiding promotions for years following the events of Top Gun (1986), Maverick
         must now confront the ugly past and an uncertain future while training the next generation of
         elite fighter pilots for an almost impossible mission. But as the veteran naval pilot stretches
         the rules to the breaking point to prepare the brilliant graduates for the top-secret assignment,
         Mitchell must also navigate an uncomfortable relationship with a hotshot lieutenant holding a grudge.
         Can Maverick and his Top Guns pull off a miracle, give the enemy hell, and return home in one piece?</p>
