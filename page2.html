    <p style="color: black;">US Navy Lieutenant Pete Mitchell, call sign Maverick--an impetuous,
         daredevil pilot ace--is accepted into Top Gun, Miramar's elite Fighter School.
          But there, the impulsive young pilot will have to compete with the best of the best,
          including Iceman, a brilliant and highly competitive fellow student. Now, Mitchell must
          give his all; however, his father's mysterious and untimely demise still haunts him.
          Can Maverick prove his worth to Charlie, the flying school's no-nonsense astrophysics
          instructor? Will he be able to suppress his wild nature to win the prestigious Top Gun Trophy?</p>
